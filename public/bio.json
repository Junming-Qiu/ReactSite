    "data1": "Growing up, both my parents worked in research labs, and I would vividly remember visiting their buildings and seeing all the various experiments and machinery at work. I had always liked experimenting with new ideas, and I thought that I would do some profession similar to my parents when I grew up. When I finally interned at a research lab in my junior year of high school, I learned that biological research was time consuming and required careful planning ahead. However, I wanted to work with more quickly obtainable results, which was why I instead shifted toward computer science.\n",
    "data2": "From my time at the research lab, I learned the importance of using time well and planning for the future. Additionally, I learned that every small detail in an instruction is carefully optimized for the best efficiency or yield. I apply all of these concepts to the programs and algorithms that I create, ensuring that each instruction is as efficient and also understandable as possible. I learned that collaboration is a key trait for the success of many projects, which is why I greatly value the usability and readability of my work.\n",
    "data3": "\nCurrently, I am a rising junior studying computer science at NYU. I am an IT technician and research student at NYU. For my IT position, I work with NYU office staff to ensure that their machines and software are configured properly, and I also diagnose and solve various issues that occur with the technology. For my research, I am working with Professor Torsten Suel on the topic of Better Clustering for Selective Search, and am currently devising algorithms which can improve search efficiency in large document collections. I plan to continue both work and hope to improve the quality of life in technology for people in both usability and efficiency.\n",
